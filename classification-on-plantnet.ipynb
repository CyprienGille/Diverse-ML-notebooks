With our oversampling technique, samples from small classes will be used for training multiple times per epoch. This will obvioulsy affect our model's ability to generalise, hence the need for another data processing technique: **data augmentation**.\n\nWe use data augmentation directly on the input of ImageFolder: all images will pass through a set of transforms (cf. comments in the code) before being fed to our model. Some of those transforms have a certain probability of happening, which means that the network will no longer train on the same oversampled images.\n\nAs a sidenote, our validation data does not need to be augmented, but it is easier and cleaner to pass the transforms to the dataset at its creation (before the split).

At the time, our main hypothesis was that the test set had a very different class distribution than the training dataset, on purpose, to force us to have very robust models. We did the EDA part of this notebook, and thought that maybe the test set was balanced. In fact, there were a few classes that our current model never predicted (the small ones), so we decided to put our hypothesis to the test.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Main trials I : ResNet with no Data Augmentation\n\nTo see if our submission accuracy issue really came from a dataset difference, we decided first to try to improve our model's performances, to see whether the test accuracy followed the validation accuracy or not.\n\nWith that goal in mind, we used a much more complex home-made model: a residual convolutional network. Seeing how similar some of the classes were, we wanted to make sure that we had a model complex enough to achieve our complex classification task.\n\nSo, after a lot of (some failed, some successful) runs, tuning of the parameters to get the best validation accuracy possible without modifying the dataset in any way, we ended up with this state of our model:\n\n|*Result of the main trials*| val_acc : 0.56 |\n|---|:---:|\n|Architecture|ResNet (see Annex)|\n|input_size|183x183|\n|dropout|0.1|\n|train_proportion|0.75|\n|splitting method|sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split|\n|batch_size|16|\n|epochs|15|\n|lr|0.01|\n|grad_clip|1|\n|weight_decay|1e-5|\n|optimizer|Adam|\n|lr scheduler|StepLR with step_size = 4|\n\nThose several runs and the experiments we did around them allowed us to establish more things:\n - Making our ResNet deeper did not have any noticeable impact on either validation accuracy nor test accuracy.\n - Using more epochs, or doing a warm restart on our trained model (i.e. recycling through the learning rate) did not improve the validation accuracy : it seemed like we reached a cap.\n - Keeping train proportion between 0.75 and 0.8 was the best tradeoff between performance and training speed.\n - As mentioned above in the code, using train_test_split instead of random_split guaranteed properly stratified train and val datasets.\n - Using StepLR performed better than both ReduceLROnPlateau using the validation accuracy, and CycleLR (increasing batch-by-batch the lr until around a third of the epochs, then going back down to a very low value).\n - Due to the residual nature of our network, some training loops displayed wild divergence of the network because of the exploding gradient problem. Using gradient clipping with values between 1 and 5 fixed that issue without slowing down convergence.\n - Weight decay improved very marginally the performances during training, but had no visible drawback.\n - Kaggle runs and sessions time out after 9 hours of runtime, so it is wise to save checkpoints of halfway-trained models of we intend to use them afterwards.\n - Our submission definitely has an issue, because it does not seem to improve even though the model itself has a better validation accuracy.\n\nAt this point, our conclusion was that we had to balance our training dataset one way or another. We blamed the inbalance in the dataset for both our validation accuracy cap, and our abysmal test score.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Main trials II : ResNet with Oversampling, and Data Augmentation\n\nWe had a few options to balance our dataset. \n\nThe first one, the brute-force one, was to physically save augmented images (rotated by some multiple of 90 degrees, lightly blurred, etc) to increase the size of each class until it reached a given threshold. There were several issue with this approach. First, determining the threshold wouldn't be easy: some classes only have around 100 samples, while the largest one has around 6000. Data augmentation has its limits before it starts to be detrimental to , and it would be unreasonable to try to increase each class to a size even a third as large as the largest one. Second, the input folder on Kaggle is read-only, and it would not be practical to have our augmented dataset be split between the input and output folders (especially since we would have to re-do the augmentation everytime, seeing as the output folder is empty at the start of every session). In short, this solution seems to be both limited in effect and cumbersome in practice. (Cf. Annex : Manual dataset balancing)\n\nThe second one was to leave the dataset intact, and use a weighted sampler to oversample the under-represented classes, and conversely undersample the over-representated classes (Cf. comments about that technique above in the code). Paired with random data augmentation on every sample, this proved to be quite effective.\n\nThe third one was to use a weighted loss, where smaller classes would have a greater impact on the loss than larger ones. Whether paired with oversampling and data augmentation or not, this actually worsened our score. However, upon inspection of the confusion matrix, it had the merit of making very small classes have many more correct predictions than before. Sadly, this improvement was largely outweighed by how worse predictions on large classes were doing.\n\nAfter even more 7-hour-long runs, tuning our new parameters, we ended up with this state of our experiments:\n\n|*Result of the main trials with oversampling and DA*| val_acc : 0.62 |\n|---|:---:|\n|Architecture|ResNet (see Annex)|\n|input_size|183x183|\n|dropout|0.1|\n|train_proportion|0.8|\n|splitting method|sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split|\n|Augmentation technique|All classes, random hflip, vflip, blur (Cf.

Annex: SmartAugmentationDataset). This gave worse results than simply performing augmentation on all samples of the dataset.\n - Since we are using a random sampler, we can ask it to give us as many sample as we want using the given weights. Training on three times our dataset takes too much time, but using twice as much samples did improve the accuracy by around 2%.\n - However, this technique constrains our number of epochs because it effectively doubles training times. \n - Because of how WeightedRandomSampler works, we have to compute the weight of each sample in the training split. This is not parallelizable (Cf. code comments above) and takes significant time.\n - The largest number of epochs we could thus use is 10.\n - This time, because we can no longer train for that many epochs, using ReduceLROnPlateau leads to better results.\n\nAround that time, we discovered that altough balancing the training data did improve the model's performances, the low scores of our submissions actually came from a witless oversight in how we produced the predicted class. In short, the number given as the output of our model was not directly a class, it was the index of the class in an alphabetically ordered list of all classes. Many thanks to M. Bahl for pointing that out on the course's slack.\n\nAfter fixing this issue, we now had to deal with a new, quadruple-faced problem. The deadline was approaching, we were running out of GPU time for our last week, the accuracy of our model seemed to have reached a cap, and (almost) everyone else on the leaderboard was sitting between 0.8 and 0.9 accuracy on the leaderboards.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Final runs : Pretrained Models\n\n\nSeeing everyone with such similar scores, with some teams having achieved their best score very early in the competition, we deduced that our colleagues were most likely using pre-trained models.\n\n*Why didn't we use pretrained models earlier?*\nTo be honest, there are probably three main reasons:\n - We wanted to see how good a custom, home-made model could get;\n - We spent around two weeks without knowing how our model would actually perform on the leaderboard;\n - All of the torchvision models are trained on ImageNet, which has 1000 very diverse classes (animals, objects, vegetables, landscapes...) : they are very general models. Our task is much more specific: for example, an overwhelming majority of images in our dataset is mostly green. Therefore, we originally thought that the dataset chosen for this competition was too specific to yield good results on general-purpose, pre-trained models. One of us having a background in NLP led us to be wary of that specificity in our task.\n\nBut we were wrong, because pre-trained models performed really, well, in smaller runtimes, than our ResNet. We first tried alexnet with and without oversampling, fine-tuning it or doing feature extraction, and fine-tuning with oversampling yielded better results. (e.g. Alexnet, no oversampling, feature extraction : 0.71. Alexnet, with oversampling, feature extraction : 0.73.)\n\n\nWe then fine-tuned resnet18, resnet152, and vgg19 (with batch normalization), with all of the techniques mentioned above (oversampling, data augmentation, gradient clipping...).\n\nIn the end (having no more GPU time nor submissions available), the best result was achieved by:\n\n|*Final performance*| val_acc: 0.82, test score: 0.81 |\n|---|:---:|\n|Architecture|resnet152 (fine-tuning)|\n|input_size|224x224|\n|train_proportion|0.8|\n|splitting method|sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split|\n|Augmentation technique|All classes, random hflip, vflip, resizing crop|\n|len(train_dataloader)|len(train_split)|\n|batch_size|8|\n|epochs|11|\n|lr|0.00001|\n|grad_clip|5|\n|weight_decay|No|\n|optimizer|Adam|\n|lr scheduler|StepLR with step_size=4|\n\nKey points:\n - The input size is determined by the architecture of resnet152. This leads to the upscaling of some of the images in our dataset, something we never experimented with (Cf. Conclusion)\n - Since we did not have much computing time remaining, we never tried to use more than len(train_split) samples through WeightedRandomSampler.\n - Fine-tuning required a much smaller learning rate than before.\n - Weight decay deteriorated the performance of our model, as it was changing the pre-trained weights.\n - StepLR became the best optimizer again, because ReduceLROnPlateau never activated due to marginal improvements being made every epoch.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\n\nThis competition was very enriching, as it covered a lot of aspects of data science: we had to choose a model, we had an unbalanced dataset...

This technique is famous for its use in Kaggle competitions, and could be performed in a number of ways. Averaging over different resnet sizes, over alexnet vgg and resnet152, over our ResNet trained on k-folds of our dataset (cross-validation then model ensembling), or even both at the same time.\n - Look at better, more recent pre-trained models, within torchvision or outside.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Annex","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Previous Models","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# convolution block avec BatchNormalization\ndef ConvBlock(in_channels, out_channels, pool=False, kernel_size=3, padding=1, stride=1, pooling_kernel_size=3):\n    \n    layers = [nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=kernel_size, padding=padding, stride=stride),\n             nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels),\n             nn.ReLU(inplace=True)]\n    if pool:\n        layers.append(nn.MaxPool2d(pooling_kernel_size))\n    return nn.Sequential(*layers)\n\n# simpler net\nclass ConvNet(PlantNetModel):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, n_classes):\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        self.conv1 = ConvBlock(in_channels, 64) #
