# Diverse ML notebooks

This repository contains several notebooks implementing/testing machine learning algorithms and techniques. 

## List of files

### `GAN_for_anime_faces.ipynb`
 
In this notebook, we implement a **DCGAN to generate faces in a manga-like style**. For this project, we used [this dataset from WANG Yaohui](https://gitlab.inria.fr/yaowang/gan_class_images.git). This notebook uses PyTorch as its ML framework.
 
### `Autoencoder_Image_Compression.ipynb`

In this notebook, we implement an **autoencoder to perform image compression**. We study the [PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) with different compression rates (i.e. different latent space dimensions). This notebook uses tensorflow as its ML framework.

### `classification-on-plantnet.ipynb` ‚≠ê

This notebook comes from a Kaggle competition (using [this subset](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cgarcin/plantnet_dataset) of the [Plantnet dataset](https://plantnet.org/en/)). This notebook comprehensively goes through the whole process of building a **classifier on image data**, from custom datasets, samplers, models, etc. Model-wise, this notebook uses **CNNs, homemade residual networks, and a fine-tuned ResNet152**. This notebook is extensively commented, and documents all of the tested configurations and their scores during the competition. This notebook uses PyTorch as its ML framework.
 
### `Image_Enhancement_Filtering.ipynb`

This notebook showcases **image manipulation, enhancement, and filtering** techniques (luminance thresholding, histogram equalization, convolution filters for denoising, frequency filtering...) written using numpy, pyplot, and pyOpenCV. The images used by this notebook (`lena_gray_512.tif` and `CLOWN_LUMI2.BMP`) are provided too. (This notebook isn't ML per se, but showcases some useful manipulations for preprocessing image data).

### `Image_Segmentation_SVMs.ipynb`

This notebook uses a **support vector machine to perform pixel-wise binary classification** on an image. We use both intensity and texture information. This notebook uses skimage, and scikit-learn as its ML framework. The images used by this notebook are provided in the *Images_Segm_SVM* folder.

Note : Some of these notebooks are the products of uni labs or projects, and may thus have a few obscure headers (for example, when they reference exercise questions or subject codes).
