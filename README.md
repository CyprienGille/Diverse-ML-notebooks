# Diverse ML notebooks

This repository contains several notebooks implementing/testing machine learning algorithms and techniques. 
Note : These notebooks are the products of uni labs or projects, and may thus have a few obscure headers (for example, when they reference exercise questions or subject codes).

## List of files

 - `GAN_for_anime_faces.ipynb` : in this notebook, we implement a DCGAN to generate faces in a manga-like style. For this project, we used [this dataset from WANG Yaohui](https://gitlab.inria.fr/yaowang/gan_class_images.git)
 - `Autoencoder_Image_Compression.ipynb` : in this notebook, we implement an autoencoder to perform image compression. We study the [PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) with different compression rates (i.e. different latent space dimensions).
